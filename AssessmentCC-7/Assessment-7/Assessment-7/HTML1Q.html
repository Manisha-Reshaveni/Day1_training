    <p><strong>dihydrogen monoxide</strong>, also known as <i>hydroxyl acid</i> or <i>DHMO</i><sup>1</sup>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup>:</p>

    <p>
        is the major component of acid rain, <br>
        contributes to the greenhouse effect, <br>
        may cause severe burns, <br>
        is fatal if inhaled, <br>
        contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape, <br>
        accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals, <br>
        may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes, <br>
        and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.

    <p>
        Despite the danger, DHMO is often used: <br>
        as an industrial solvent and coolant, <br>
        in nuclear power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>, <br>
        as a fire retardant, <br>
        in many forms of cruel animal research, <br>
        as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products, <br>
        in the distribution of pesticides. <br>

    <p> Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.</p>
